        <h2>Here's a time line of Dmitri Mendeleev's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1834</strong> - born in the village of Verkhnie Aremzyani, near Tobolsk in Siberia to Ivan Pavlovich Mendeleev and Maria Dmitrievna Mendeleeva. </li>
          <li><strong>1847</strong> - attended the Gymnasium in Tobolsk</li>
          <li><strong>1849</strong> - moved with mother to Moscow with the aim of getting Mendeleev a higher education. The university in Moscow did not accept him. The mother and son continued to St. Petersburg to the father’s alma mater</li>
          <li><strong>1850</strong> - entered the Main Pedagogical Institute</li>
          <li><strong>1855</strong> - contracted tuberculosis, causing him to move to the Crimean Peninsula on the northern coast of the Black Sea. While there he became a science master of the Simferopol gymnasium №1</li>
          <li><strong>1857</strong> - returned to Saint Petersburg with fully restored health</li>
          <li><strong>1859..1861</strong> - worked on the capillarity of liquids and the workings of the spectroscope in Heidelberg</li>
          <li><strong>1861</strong> - published a textbook named Organic Chemistry, that won him the Demidov Prize of the Petersburg Academy of Sciences</li>
          <li><strong>1862</strong> - became married to Feozva Nikitichna Leshcheva</li>
          <li><strong>1864</strong> - became a professor at the Saint Petersburg Technological Institute</li>
          <li><strong>1865</strong> - became a professor at the Saint Petersburg State University and a Doctor of Science for his dissertation "On the Combinations of Water with Alcohol"</li>
          <li><strong>1867</strong> - achieved tenure at St. Petersburg University and started to teach inorganic chemistry, while succeeding Voskresenskii to this post and by 1871 he had transformed Saint Petersburg into an internationally recognized center for chemistry research</li>
          <li><strong>1868..1870</strong> - wrote the definitive textbook of his time: Principles of Chemistry (two volumes). This is when he made his most important discovery. As he attempted to classify the elements according to their chemical properties, he noticed patterns that led him to postulate his periodic table; he claimed to have envisioned the complete arrangement of the elements in a dream</li>
          <li><strong>1882</strong> - became married second time to Anna Ivanova Popova. Was Elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London and awarded with the Davy Medal
          <li><strong>1893</strong> - appointed director of the Bureau of Weights and Measures, a post which he occupied till his death</li>
          <li><strong>1905</strong> - elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Royal Society of London awarded him the Copley Medal in 1905</li>
          <li><strong>1906</strong> - was recommended to the Swedish Academy to award the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 1906 to Mendeleev for his discovery of the periodic system. The Chemistry Section of the Swedish Academy supported this recommendation. The Academy was then supposed to approve the Committee's choice, as it has done in almost every case. Unexpectedly, at the full meeting of the Academy, a dissenting member of the Nobel Committee, Peter Klason, proposed the candidacy of Henri Moissan whom he favored. Svante Arrhenius, although not a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, had a great deal of influence in the Academy and also pressed for the rejection of Mendeleev, arguing that the periodic system was too old to acknowledge its discovery in 1906. According to the contemporaries, Arrhenius was motivated by the grudge he held against Mendeleev for his critique of Arrhenius's dissociation theory. After heated arguments, the majority of the Academy voted for Moissan. The attempts to nominate Mendeleev in 1907 were again frustrated by the absolute opposition of Arrhenius</li>
          <li><strong>1907</strong> - died at the age of 72 in Saint Petersburg from influenza. The crater Mendeleev on the Moon, as well as element number 101, the radioactive mendelevium, are named after him</li>
        </ul>

          <p>"I saw in a dream a table where all elements fell into place as required. Awakening, I immediately wrote it down on a piece of paper, only in one place did a correction later seem necessary."</p>
